# Obsidian
To be consistent with everyone working on the report, use the tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Open the report folder as a vault in obsidian. The entire report will be written in markdown. Whenever you make changes, be sure to `git add`, `git commit -m "added X to report"` and `git push` so others can `git pull` your changes
# Report
Every chapter should be created in its own separate chapter file. The full report will be automatically generated from all files combined.

# External Resources (e.g. images)
external resources should be added to the Resources folder. They can be added into the report where necessary by using the `![[Resources/FileName]]` notation.

# Quoting
Quotes used in the report get their own note in the Quotes folder. each note should have a heading `## Quote` containing the actual quote. and a heading `## Reference` containing the text shown when referencing the quote.
To actually reference a quote use the `![[quote note#Reference|no-embed-title]]` notation.
